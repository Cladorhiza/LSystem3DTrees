todo:

learn about geometry shader, could be the key to optimisation of vertex generation





things that can be optimised:

glbufferdata is too slow for industry, find alternative.

use one vbo with stride/offsets potentially for less transactions between gpu/cpu

prevent duplicates from generating turtle graphic trees

particle systems aka systems that update vbos per frame use 3 buffers and alternate between them because there's a small delay when calling glbufferdata
